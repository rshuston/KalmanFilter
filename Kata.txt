Assume you are part of a team that is developing a monitoring system that needs to track an object whose single-axis position parameter typically changes at a constant rate (e.g., a remote-controlled race car).  The system will measure the object's position values at discrete time points, nominally every second, and the measurements will be contaminated by noise due to sensor jitter and hardware timing.  The object position dynamics can be modeled using a linear process model, and the hardware measurement noise can be modeled by a Gaussian noise model of zero mean and unity variance.As part of your role on the team, you are to implement a two-state Kalman filter library that can be used to initiate and maintain a position-velocity estimate on a moving object as described in the preceding paragraph.  The code must be written in ANSI C.  The library public module must be named PVKalmanFilter.c along with a companion PVKalmanFilter.h header file.The library must use a structure that contains at least the following fields:typedef struct PVKalmanFilterState{    unsigned id;            /* id tag to distinguish this track from others */    double   t;             /* most recent time of update, seconds */    double   z;             /* most recent measurement */    double   x[2];          /* estimated state vector, [ pos, vel ] */    double   P[2][2];       /* estimated state error covariance: */                            /* [   var_pos ,  covar_posvel ] */                            /* [ covar_posvel , var_vel    ] */    /* ... any additional fields needed to maintain filter state ... */} PVKalmanFilterState;The PVKalmanFilter.c library must use the companion PVKalmanFilter.h header file to define the PVKalmanFilterState structure.  The library must provide at least two public functions:1. An initialization function that has the following signature:    int PVKalmanFilterInit(struct PVKalmanFilterState *state,                           unsigned id,                           double t,                           double z,                           double P[2][2])    /* state = filter state to initialize for accepting subsequent updates */    /* id = id tag to be assigned to filter state */    /* t = time of initial measurement */    /* z = initial measurement to be used to initialize the state */    /* P = initial state error covariance: */    /*     [   var_pos ,  covar_posvel ] */    /*     [ covar_posvel , var_vel    ] */The return code must be PVKF_SUCCESS (0) for success, and PVKF_ERROR (-1) for any errors that may be detected during the initialization (e.g., a NULL state pointer).2. A one-step driver function that has the following signature:    int PVKalmanFilterUpdate(struct PVKalmanFilterState *state,                             double t,                             double z)    /* state = filter state to update with new measurement */    /* t = time of new measurement */    /* z = the new measurement */The return code must be PVKF_SUCCESS (0) for success, and PVKF_ERROR (-1) for any errors that may be detected during the update (e.g., a NULL state pointer).  If an error does occur, the filter state values listed above must be preserved to what they were prior to the PVKalmanFilterUpdate() invocation.You should be able to design your filter so that it has an impulse response of no more than 30% once the filter has achieved a sufficiently steady state (i.e., it rejects at least 70% of a noise spike).  For this kata, you can assume sufficient steady state behavior after 10 filter updates.Do not assume that the time points will be regularly spaced; they could jitter by 0.05 s or more due to sensor acquisition timing.The library code must be implemented such that its source files can be integrated into an application's makefile build procedures such that the application needs to rely only on the information available in PVKalmanFilter.h in order to use the library.  The application will allocate a new PVKalmanFilterState structure, initiate a new track using PVKalmanFilterInit(), and update it with PVKalmanFilterUpdate().You may implement additional source files in your library than just PVKalmanFilter.c and PVKalmanFilter.h, but PVKalmanFilter.h must be the interface file that the application uses to run your filter.  All files must be provided so that they can be integrated into the main application's makefile.The PVKalmanFilter.h header must utilize C++ guards to allow the library to be used in C++ projects at some point in the future:    #ifndef _PVKalmanFilter_h_    #define _PVKalmanFilter_h_    #ifdef __cplusplus    extern "C" {    #endif    /* Header definitions here */    #ifdef __cplusplus    }    #endif    #endifThe library code must be architected so that it does not need to perform any block memory management (i.e., no malloc()/free() cycles), and the library cannot throw asserts.  You are allowed (encouraged!) to amend the PVKalmanFilterState data fields as necessary with the essential items to maintain a persistent filter state across PVKalmanFilterUpdate() invocations.  In addition, you must not use file-scope global variables to maintain filter state; assume that more than one tracking filter may be running.The library should be implemented as simply as needed to achieve proper functionality. There are a number of advanced Kalman filtering techniques that can be used for implementations suitable for mission-critical applications, but they are outside the scope of this kata.The library should be implemented efficiently and without wasteful execution overhead. Matrix loops should be concise.The library implementation must be readable and understandable such that it is easy to follow the logic and the mechanics of the Kalman filter equations.Development environment:• The code must build and run on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.• The code must build and run using GCC as the compiler toolchain and GNU make as the project build environment.• You must use Git for version control.• You must use the libcheck (https://github.com/libcheck/check) testing framework to develop the PVKalmanFilter library, and you must include the testing files and project files with your submission to demonstrate proper behavior.
